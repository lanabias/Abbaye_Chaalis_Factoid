# Abbaye_Chaalis_Factoid
This case study examines the relationships between the Cistercian abbey of Chaalis and various external groups, particularly the French nobility, in the medieval context of Île-de-France. It aims to address gaps in existing research on these interactions by using network analysis to highlight collaborations between the abbey and external individuals, including nobles, other ecclesiastical communities, villages, and commoners. The findings show that the French nobility prioritized the Cistercian Order in their religious benefaction strategies, seeking to gain the order's support in exchange for their dominion over lands and populations (see my article : Laurent Albert Nabias. The Nobility networks of the royal Cistercian abbey of Chaalis in the years 1180-1184 and 1223-1234. Cîteaux Commentarii Cistercienses, 2022, 73 (1-4), pp.145-170. ⟨hal-04283858⟩). Founded in 1137 and affiliated with Pontigny Abbey, Chaalis Abbey is located about 40 km north of Paris, near the royal city of Senlis, and comprises several granges worked by lay brothers. This research thus sheds light on the social and political dynamics between Cistercian monasteries and secular powers in the Middle Ages.

The research for this study on Chaalis Abbey relied on several key historical documents, primarily the medieval cartulary preserved as Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS Latin 11003. This cartulary, dating from the 14th century with later additions from the 15th and 16th centuries, comprises 392 folios and includes 1,700 charter notices classified mainly by grange, covering the period from 1021 to 1484. The medieval cartulary is described by the IRHT, http://regecart.irht.cnrs.fr/dossier-137-R1/ms-0117. In addition to the cartulary, original charters that were copied or summarized within it were consulted, found in the Oise departmental archives and in a twelve-volume compendium of charters at Chaalis Abbey. These original documents often provided crucial additional information, such as kinship relationships, which were essential for constructing the network analysis. This combination of comprehensive cartulary data and original charters allowed for a rich exploration of the abbey's relationships, property management, and social connections over several centuries. These relationships are numberous : kinship, friendship, collegiality, neighbourhood, but also economic relations (economic transfers, donations, exchanges, etc...), juridical relationships, vassal-like dependances.

The database was initially constructed using Access and subsequently migrated to SQL. The goal is to implement the CIDOC-CRM and feudal models developed by Michele Pasin and John Bradley, as outlined in their 2014 publication "Factoid-based Prosopography and Computer Ontologies: towards an integrated approach". However, this implementation presents significant challenges. As an intermediate step, the use of XML-TEI is being considered to begin modeling the relationships within the data. This approach is supported by existing literature, such as the article by Daniel L. Schwartz, Nathan P. Gibson, and Katayoun Torabi titled "Modeling a Born-Digital Factoid Prosopography using the TEI and Linked Data". While this article has not yet been thoroughly reviewed, it offers promising insights into the application of XML-TEI for prosopographical modeling.
